# NBA Home Court Advantage Prediction
[![View Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20in%20nbviewer-orange?logo=jupyter)](https://nbviewer.org/github/raghavchhabra123/NBA_HomeCourt_Advantage/blob/main/PredictNBAGamesProject.ipynb)

**Goal:**  
Build a **leak-free machine learning pipeline** that predicts the **probability of an NBA home team winning** using only **pre-game data** such as recent form, rest days, and standings.

---

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how time-aware feature engineering and leak-free modeling can simulate realistic NBA forecasting.  
All features are created using only data available *before tipoff*, ensuring the model never “cheats” with post-game stats.

---

## Methods
- Data cleaning and merging (`games.csv`, `ranking.csv`, `teams.csv`)
- Rolling win rates, rest-day, and home-frequency feature engineering
- Chronological train/test split to prevent data leakage
- Classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Metrics: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, Brier Score, and Calibration

---

## Key Insights
- Teams with stronger **recent form** and higher **pre-game win %** are most likely to win at home  
- **Rest advantage** has a measurable but smaller effect  
- The model achieved strong **ROC-AUC (~0.70)** with realistic calibration

## Next Steps
- Incorporate Elo ratings or Vegas odds for richer pre-game context  
- Add player-level features (injuries, travel fatigue)  
- Explore rolling-origin cross-validation for time-series tuning
